# project-6

I created an EC2 instance from AWS console , one instance as web server and the second as database server and i added three volumes to each of the instance.

I installed wordpress on my webserver.

Then on my database server i installed mysql and cofigured my database to work with wordpress.

I futhered install mysql client on my webserver so i could connect from my webserver to my database and i accepted all traffic on my inbound rules.

The project implementation was a success because i didnt have a blocker and my wordpress came up on my browser.
